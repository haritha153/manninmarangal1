        <section class="section card">
            <h2>Cultivation & Production</h2>
            <p>Almond cultivation is a significant agricultural industry in several parts of the world:</p>
            
            <div class="fact-grid" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Major Producers</h3>
                    <p>The United States (primarily California) is the world's largest producer, accounting for approximately 80% of global commercial almond production. Other significant producers include Spain, Australia, Iran, Italy, and Morocco.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Growing Conditions</h3>
                    <p>Almond trees thrive in Mediterranean climates with mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. They require well-draining soil, full sun exposure, and approximately 500-600 chill hours (temperatures between 32-45°F/0-7°C) during winter to properly set fruit.</p>

                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Pollination</h3>
                    <p>Almond trees are not self-pollinating and depend heavily on honey bees for cross-pollination. The California almond bloom requires the world's largest managed pollination event, with over 1.5 million beehives transported to the orchards annually.</p>

                    <h3>Harvesting</h3>
                    <p>Almonds are typically harvested in late summer when the outer hull splits open and begins to dry. Modern harvesting involves mechanical tree shakers that drop the nuts to the ground, where they are collected, hulled, and dried before processing.</p>

                    <p>The common edible variety (Prunus dulcis var. dulcis) grown commercially for consumption. Major varieties include Nonpareil (thin-shelled, used for snacking), Mission (hard-shelled, used in processed foods), and Carmel (versatile, used in various applications).</p>

                    <p>Prunus dulcis var. amara contains amygdalin, which transforms into toxic hydrogen cyanide when processed. Bitter almonds are used in small quantities for flavoring extracts after processing to remove toxins, and in some traditional medicines under careful preparation.</p>

                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Classification by Use</h3>
                    <p>Almonds are categorized based on their intended use: snacking varieties (larger, more attractive), manufacturing varieties (for processing into products), and all-purpose varieties that work well for both purposes.</p>

            <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
            <p>Almond cultivation has significant environmental considerations, particularly in large-scale production:</p>

                    <h3>Water Usage</h3>
                    <p>Almond trees require significant water for optimal production, with each kernel requiring approximately 1.1 gallons of water to produce. This has raised concerns in drought-prone regions like California, leading to innovations in irrigation efficiency and water management.</p>

                    <h3>Pollinator Health</h3>
                    <p>The intensive use of honey bees for almond pollination has implications for bee health. Industry efforts are underway to develop bee-friendly farming practices, including reducing pesticide use during bloom and creating habitat for native pollinators.</p>

                    <h3>Carbon Sequestration</h3>
                    <p>As perennial woody plants, almond trees sequester carbon throughout their lifetime. The California almond industry has set goals to achieve carbon neutrality or better through improved orchard management practices and utilizing byproducts.</p>

                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>By-Product Utilization</h3>
                    <p>Innovations are reducing waste by repurposing almond hulls and shells for animal feed, bioenergy, and biodegradable plastics. The woody material from orchard removals is increasingly used for cogeneration or as soil amendments rather than being burned.</p>

                    <h3>Not a True Nut</h3>
                    <p>Botanically speaking, almonds aren't actually nuts but drupes—fruits with an outer fleshy part surrounding a shell containing a seed. Other drupes include peaches, cherries, and plums, all relatives of the almond in the Prunus genus.</p>

                    <h3>Early Bloomers</h3>
                    <p>Almond trees are among the first to bloom in late winter/early spring, making them symbols of rebirth and new beginnings in many cultures. Their early flowering also makes them vulnerable to late frosts, a risk for growers.</p>

                    <p>Almonds are one of the most versatile plant foods, processed into almond milk, almond flour, almond butter, marzipan, nougat, and countless other forms. They're also the most consumed tree nut in the world, with global consumption exceeding 1.2 million metric tons annually.</p>

                    <p>Almond milk is not a modern invention—it was a staple in medieval European cooking, especially during Lent when animal products were forbidden. Historical cookbooks from the 13th century contain numerous recipes using almond milk as a dairy substitute.</p>
