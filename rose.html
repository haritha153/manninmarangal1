                    <h3>Hybrid Tea Roses</h3>
                    <p>The most popular modern roses, characterized by their large, well-formed blooms on long stems. They typically flower continuously throughout the season and are the standard roses found in florist shops.</p>

                    <p>These roses have long, flexible canes that can be trained along walls, trellises, and arches. Climbers typically have larger flowers while ramblers produce masses of smaller blooms, often with a single flowering period.</p>

            <p>Successful rose cultivation requires understanding their specific needs and growth habits:</p>
            
            <div class="fact-grid" style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Sunlight Requirements</h3>
                    <p>Roses perform best with 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Morning sun is preferable as it helps dry dew quickly, reducing disease risk. In hotter climates, afternoon shade can be beneficial.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Soil Conditions</h3>
                    <p>Roses prefer well-draining, slightly acidic soil (pH 6.0-6.5) rich in organic matter. Clay soils should be amended with compost to improve drainage, while sandy soils benefit from added organic material to increase water retention.</p>

                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Watering</h3>
                    <p>Deep, regular watering is crucial, especially during dry periods. Water at the base of plants to keep foliage dry. Established roses typically need 1-2 inches of water weekly, more during hot weather.</p>

                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Pruning</h3>
                    <p>Most roses benefit from annual pruning in late winter or early spring before new growth appears. Remove dead, damaged, or diseased wood, and shape the plant to promote air circulation and outward growth.</p>
