            <p>The Banana tree (Musa species), often incorrectly called a tree as it's actually a large herbaceous plant, is among the world's most valuable food crops. Native to Southeast Asia and cultivated throughout tropical regions, it provides not just the familiar yellow fruit but also offers numerous other uses from its leaves, flowers, and stem. Bananas are a staple food for millions of people, especially in developing countries, and are cultivated in over 150 countries worldwide.</p>

                    <h3>Soil Health</h3>
                    <p>Banana plants help prevent soil erosion due to their extensive root systems. The plants also add organic matter to the soil when they die after fruiting, enhancing soil fertility naturally.</p>

                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Not Actually a Tree</h3>
                    <p>Despite being called a tree, the banana plant is actually the world's largest herbaceous plant. What appears to be a trunk is actually a pseudostem made up of tightly packed leaf sheaths.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Clones and Seedless Fruits</h3>
                    <p>Most commercially grown bananas are genetically identical clones of the Cavendish variety. These bananas are parthenocarpic, meaning their fruits develop without pollination, resulting in seedless fruits.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Once-in-a-Lifetime Fruiting</h3>
                    <p>A banana plant produces fruit only once in its lifetime. After fruiting, the mother plant dies, but new shoots, called suckers or pups, grow from the base to replace it, continuing the cycle.</p>

                    <h3>Floating Gardens</h3>
                    <p>In flood-prone areas of Bangladesh and parts of Southeast Asia, farmers create floating gardens using banana plants as rafts. As the plants decompose, they create a nutrient-rich base for growing other crops.</p>

                    <p>Botanically speaking, bananas are berries, not fruits. They develop from a single flower with one ovary and have seeds embedded in the flesh (though modern cultivated varieties have tiny, undeveloped seeds).</p>

                    <p>Bananas are the fourth most important food crop in the world after rice, wheat, and corn. They are a critical food source in many developing countries, providing essential nutrition to millions of people daily.</p>
