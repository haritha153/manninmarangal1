                    <h3>Colonial History</h3>
                    <p>The term "Banyan" originated during colonial times when European traders observed Hindu merchants called "Banias" conducting business under these trees, leading to the adoption of the name for the tree itself.</p>

                    <h3>Fig Wasps</h3>
                    <p>Like all fig trees, the Banyan has a unique symbiotic relationship with specific fig wasp species. The tree cannot reproduce without these wasps, which lay their eggs inside the fig flowers and pollinate them in the process.</p>

                    <h3>Single Organism</h3>
                    <p>Despite appearing like a small forest from a distance, a Banyan with all its trunks and aerial roots is actually a single connected organism, making it one of the largest plant organisms in the world by area covered.</p>
